# SeqFISH_ADCG
This package is a modified version of Nicholas Boyd's package, [SparseInverseProblems](https://github.com/nboyd/SparseInverseProblems.jl), accompanying his paper [The Alternating Descent Conditional Gradient Method for Sparse Inverse Problems](https://doi.org/10.1137/15M1035793).
A [copy](paper.pdf) of the paper is included in this repository.

Install with `Pkg.add("https://github.com/CaiLab/SeqFISH_ADCG")`.

An example notebook is available for use with [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/CaiGroup/SeqFISH_ADCG.jl/blob/master/example_notebooks/colab/example_FitDots.jl.ipynb).
